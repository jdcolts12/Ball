# Start the Dev Server

The code builds successfully! The issue is just starting the dev server.

## Run this in your terminal:

```bash
cd "/Users/joeydias/Desktop/Cursor Project 1/football-trivia"
npm run dev
```

**The server will start on:** `http://localhost:3000/` or `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`

Open that URL in your browser to see your NFL-themed changes!

---

## Alternative: Preview the built version

If the dev server still has issues, you can preview the built version:

```bash
cd "/Users/joeydias/Desktop/Cursor Project 1/football-trivia"
npm run build
npm run preview
```

This will serve the production build locally.
