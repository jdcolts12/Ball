# Test Your Timer - Deployment is Ready!

"Ready" = Your site is LIVE! ✅  
"Stale" = There's a newer deployment, but this one works fine.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Visit Your Site

1. **Click "Visit" button** on the deployment (or use the URL)
2. **IMPORTANT: Open in INCOGNITO window:**
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + N` (Chrome) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Safari)
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + N`

**Why incognito?** Your browser caches the old version. Incognito = fresh version.
